//Challenge: Waving snowman
//In this first step, I'll use the rect() command to draw the ground, so that the snowman isn't just floating in air. I'll  add  rect() command before the ellipse() commands for the snowman, so that the snowman looks like he is in front of the ground.
rect (4, 347, 400, 50);
ellipse(200, 300, 150, 150);
ellipse(200, 200, 100, 100);
ellipse(200, 120, 75, 75);
line(160, 200, 50, 150);
line(240, 200, 50, 250);
