<!--Project: Blog

A "blog" (or "web log") is an online journal, which one or multiple people update on a frequent basis, like daily, weekly, or monthly. Many new programmers keep blogs to document their journey to becoming a programmer, with updates on what they've learned and what they've made.

There are many "blogging engines" out there, like WordPress and Blogger, but in this project, you'll make your own blog using HTML and CSS. It should have at least 2 entries, and the table of contents should internally link to each entry. Use CSS text properties to style your blog - like changing the font family, line height, and font styles of various sections.

If you like your blog, then you could use it to document your journey here - make it a featured project on your profile, then people that visit your profile will get to read about your journey!
