//Project: Fish tank
// This program draws a single fish. Poor lonely fish! For this project, you'll use functions to accompany him with more fish of all different shapes and colors.

//Create a custom function (like drawFish) that draws a fish. You can build on the starter code or start from scratch.
//Add at least 2 parameters to the function declaration that control either the position or the size of the fish.
//Now call that function many times, with different values as arguments, so that your screen is filled with fish.
//Bonus: Add more parameters to the function declaration, like color, tail width, eye size, tail colorâ€”more ways that you can make each fish different from each other.
//Bonus: Add seaweed to the tank, pebbles at the bottom, or bubbles floating to the top. Whatever objects you add, make a function to draw them at different places.
//Bonus: Want to make it interactive? Use a mouseClicked function to add more fish wherever the user clicks.
