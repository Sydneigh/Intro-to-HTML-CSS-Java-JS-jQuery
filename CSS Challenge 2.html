<!--Project: Travel webpage. In this project, you'll use everything you've learned so far to create a travel website enticing viewers to visit an exotic locale. You should have images of what they'll see, lists of things to see and places to go, and paragraphs of enticing details. You should also use CSS to style the website, using a mix of the simple selectors you've learned.

Tip: Can't find the images you want in our image selector? You can also bring in images from Wikipedia. To do that, use a site-restricted Google search, then click "View image" on the result you like, and copy the URL into your <img> tag.
